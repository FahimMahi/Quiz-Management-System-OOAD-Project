# Quiz-Management-System-OOAD-Project
The Quiz Management system allows students to take quizzes online, provided by their respective teachers without the need to be present physically which acts as the main objective for creating this application, due to the pandemic. I have done this project in Object Oriented Analysis and Design Course.
